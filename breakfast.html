                    <p>
                        <b>Mini Cinnamon Rolls 7 Ingredients: </b>  <br>
                        <br>
                        Refrigerated crescent roll dough: I like to use Annie’s since it’s made with more natural ingredients but Pillsbury will work great too.<br>
                        Butter: This helps the cinnamon sugar stick. Unsalted is recommended but since it’s only a few tablespoons salted butter would be fine.<br>
                        Cinnamon: You can adjust the amount of cinnamon based on personal preference if you’d like.<br>
                        Brown sugar: Don’t substitute white sugar. Brown sugar works best here.<br>
                        Powdered sugar: This is used for the icing. As with just about any recipe sift your powdered sugar first if it’s clumpy.<br>
                        Milk: Adjust the amount added to reach desired consistency. I like it somewhat thin and runny.<br>
                        Vanilla extract: A little will go a long way, plus here you don’t want to overdue it or it will start to tint the icing.<br>

                        <b>For these easy crepes you’ll only need 7 basic ingredients:</b><br>
                        <br>
                        Milk: I like to use 2% milk here for the best consistency. Whole milk will works too but I like to add an extra tablespoon or two since it has a thicker consistency.<br>
                        Flour: All-purpose flour works best here to build up the structure. Nothing too delicate and nothing too protein rich (which would make the crepes overly chewy).<br>
                        Sugar: This makes the crepes a little more tender and adds a hint of sweet flavor.<br>
                        Salt: Don’t skip this ingredient, it really brings out the flavor in the crepes so they aren’t flat.<br>
                        Butter: Though not every recipes uses this I see it as a must. It adds rich flavor, makes them more tender, and it prevents them from sticking to the pan.<br>
                        Vanilla: Used to add a light background flavor. If you are making savory crepes you can omit this.<br>
                        Eggs: Eggs are a crucial ingredient in crepes. They bind everything together.<br>

                            <b>For this recipe you’ll only need 7 basic ingredients which you may already have. You’ll need:</b><br>
                            <br>
                            All-purpose flour: I like to use unbleached flour but bleached will work fine too.<br>
                            Baking powder: This helps the donuts puff up, don’t skip it.<br>
                            Salt: Just use standard table salt. Nothing special here.<br>
                            Buttermilk: I don’t recommend substitutes here, the milk and vinegar substitute isn’t quite thick enough.<br>
                            Granulated sugar: You’ll add this to both the donut dough and use for rolling.<br>
                            Melted butter: This adds a delicious flavor to the donuts. Stick with real butter.<br>
                            Vegetable oil: Needed for frying.<br>
