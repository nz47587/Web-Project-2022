            I love all things food. Let me rephrase that, I love all things good food. I’m picky about what I like and 
            I’d like to say I know great food. My favorite foods include all things Italian or Mexican, anything with chocolate, 
            caramel, fresh fruit or browned butter (is there a better scent in the world?). I don’t know how I’d live without the 
            comfort food classics like pizza and enchiladas, all those indulgent dishes loaded with an abundance of gooey melted cheese. 
            I’m a meat eater. Cookie dough is my weakness. The one food I think should be illegal is canned beets, they terrify me. 
            Sugar is my addiction. I could live in the kitchen. I like to make food look pretty, because when it looks 
            good doesn’t it just taste better?", "description2"=>"My goal here is to publish recipes that you, your family and your friends will not only love but will want to make time 
            and time again. I hope to inspire you as a home cook and boost your confidence in the kitchen. Life is meant to be enjoyed 
            and doesn’t good food just make it more enjoyable?", "p1"=>"+383 38 541 400", "p2"=>"recipes@gmail.com", "p3"=>"Lagjja Kalabria,10000 Prishtine, Kosovo" ]
