                        <b>Mini Cinnamon Rolls 7 Ingredients: </b>  <br>
                        <br>
                        Refrigerated crescent roll dough: I like to use Annie’s since it’s made with more natural ingredients but Pillsbury will work great too.<br>
                        Butter: This helps the cinnamon sugar stick. Unsalted is recommended but since it’s only a few tablespoons salted butter would be fine.<br>
                        Cinnamon: You can adjust the amount of cinnamon based on personal preference if you’d like.<br>
                        Brown sugar: Don’t substitute white sugar. Brown sugar works best here.<br>
                        Powdered sugar: This is used for the icing. As with just about any recipe sift your powdered sugar first if it’s clumpy.<br>
                        Milk: Adjust the amount added to reach desired consistency. I like it somewhat thin and runny.<br>
                        Vanilla extract: A little will go a long way, plus here you don’t want to overdue it or it will start to tint the icing.<br>

                    <h3>Marinated Grilled Salmon</h3>

                        <b>To make the grilled salmon marinade, you’ll need the following ingredients:</b><br>
                        <br>
                        
                            Side of salmon <br>
                            Soy sauce <br>
                            Dijon mustard <br>
                            Olive oil <br>
                            Garlic <br>
                            Fresh parsley (optional) <br>
                            <br>

                            It has a well rounded flavor, it had just the right amount of saltiness and depth 
                            (from the soy sauce-based salmon marinade), and it had just enough tang and spice from the 
                            vinegar and mustard seed (in the mustard).
                            The only thing I changed was to take the olive oil down 2 tsp to 1/3 cup because it’s 
                            easier to measure vs. 6 Tbsp. Then I upped the garlic three times the original amount because I love garlic.<br>

                            <br>
                            Chicken thighs: Bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs are used here for more flavor.<br>
                            Olive oil: This is used to encourage browning.<br>
                            Lemon: The zest is used to season the chicken, then wedges are used for spritzing upon serving. I like to wait to add the juice just so chicken skin gets crispier in the oven without the added liquid.<br>
                            Garlic: Another alternative is to use 2 tsp garlic powder.<br>
                            Italian seasoning: Make your own blend using 1 tsp each basil, oregano, and thyme then 1/2 tsp each marjoram and rosemary.<br>
                            Paprika: This adds a nice light flavor and also improves color.<br>
                            Salt and pepper: Season with a fair amount.<br>
                        </p>
